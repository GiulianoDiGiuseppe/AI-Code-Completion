# Python Environment Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up a Python environment for your project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

You can check if Python and pip are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```


## Creating a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. Hereâ€™s how to create one:

1. **Navigate to your project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

## Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the required dependencies. If you have a `requirements.txt` file, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
